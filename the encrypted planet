    so here is a very short briefing on why i created this station. 
    first, if you are curious about the name lovanitheus, you may refer to the "about" section. 
    i have written a description there.
    second, since github is a free cyberspace while all of its simplified chinese isn't, 
    i just want to preserve an imagined panet for myself.
    mostly, i will just put some non-senses here.
    so it is full of bubbles.
    and, for human intereactions in here, 
    i would call those who believe that art is free the lovanese,
    and hope to connect to y'all with no censorship.
    additionally, i would like to give my gratitude and respect to Terminus.
    hope they'll be freed soon.
    
    welcome.
