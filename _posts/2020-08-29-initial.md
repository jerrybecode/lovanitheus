hello.

so here is a very short briefing on why i created this site. 
 
first, if you are curious about the name lovanitheus, 

you may refer to the "about" section. 

i have put a description up there. 

second, since github is a free cyberspace while all of its simplified chinese counterparts ain't, 

i just want to preserve an imagined planet for myself. 

mostly, i will just put some non-senses here. 

so it is full of bubbles. 

and, for human interactions in here,

please remember, i don't wanna be disruptted by any substantials.

additionally, i would like to give my great gratitude and respect to Terminus. 

free.


welcome.
